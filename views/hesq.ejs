                                The responsible use of nature and its resources, the protection of human health and the environment are basic principles of our business operations. We are aware of our responsibility towards our colleagues, suppliers, and everyone involved in the production process, as well as towards the environment whose resources we responsibly use. Through the production activity, we continuously take care of health, safety, and the environment (HSE)

                            <p>
                                The Health, Safety and Environment field is the responsibility of our IMS Manager within the organization, this is monitored by our external HSE manager, and together they ensure that all ESM procedures, laws and regulations are adhered to.

                                Up from 2015, we hold all the relevant certifications (ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001), all with regard to working conditions and safety as well as the environment. In addition, our employees are given all the training from our HSE Manager that they need and hold all the necessary certificates.                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Up from 2018, we extended our production processes with quality standards ISO 3834-2 n and EN 1019-2.

                                Our operations are energy-efficient, we use raw materials sparingly and we separate our waste. We monitor consumption and are continually making adjustments in order to improve our performance in this area.

                                OHSAS 18001 is an International Standard that specifies requirements for an occupational health and safety (OH&S) management system, with guidance for its use, to enable an organization to proactively improve OH&S performance in preventing injury and ill-health.

                                This standard sets the quality requirements for the production and determines the quality assurance principles of the welded products. With this, the high quality of your products is already guaranteed during production.

                                Besides the annual inspections by certification bodies, we also carry out inspections ourselves. Our inspections are based on random checks made at the beginning and end of our production processes. So we can guarantee the highest level of quality as standard
